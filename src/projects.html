                    LLM-based Sentiment Analysis of Slovak Tweets
                    <p class="project_description">
                        This was my final semester project for my graduate-level Natural Language Processing class, LING 581. 
                        Since the first transformer-based Slovak language model of significant size, 
                        <a href="https://huggingface.co/gerulata/slovakbert">SlovakBERT</a>
                        , was
                        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15254"> published</a> 
                        in October of 2021, I decided to use it to replicate their then state-of-the-art performance of sentiment classification
                        in the Slovak language. This was my first experience reproducing the results of an academic paper, and I learned a lot as I
                        used the Hugging Face and queried the Twitter API to collect the data I needed.
